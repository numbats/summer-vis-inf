# I will be talking about :


My summer research project on a visual inference study on appropriate residual diagnostics for multi-level models.

Project Supervisors : Professor Dianne Cook and Dr. Emi Tanaka

 Based on the Master's thesis titled, "Visual inference for graphical diagnostics of linear mixed models" written by Kaiwen Jin, a Master's student at Monash University.

# Linear Mixed Models

* An extension of simple linear models as it allow both fixed and random effects, and are particularly used when there is non independence in the data.

*For example :*

* When there are multiple levels, such as patients seen by the same doctor, the variability in the outcome can be thought of as being either within group or between group.

 + Patient level observations are not independent, as within a given doctor, patients are more similar. 
 + The unit at highest level, that is the doctors are independent. 
 
 
* In case of fitting complex correlated data structures, Linear mixed model (LMM) is more versatile, as it accounts the dependency between the units.


---

* LMM goes by other names,

 + Panel data model in Econometrics.

--

 + Hierarchical model or multi-level model in Social science.

--

* Also called the mixed-effects model as it consists of a mix of fixed and random effects.

--

* Mathematical form of linear mixed model is as follows : 

 + For $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ non-overlapping groups, a linear mixed model may be expressed as
$$\underset{(m_i \times 1)}{\mathbf{y}_i} = \underset{(m_i \times p)}{\mathbf{X}_i} \underset{(p\times 1)}{\boldsymbol{\beta}} + \underset{(m_i \times q)}{\mathbf{Z}_i}\underset{(q \times 1)}{\mathbf{b}_i} + \underset{(m_i \times 1)}{\mathbf{e}_i}$$


where $\mathbf{y}_i$ is vector of response, $\mathbf{X}_i$ is fixed-effects design or regressor matrix and $\mathbf{Z}_i$ corresponds to the random effects matrix and $\mathbf e$ is a vector of random errors. 


---

# Residual Analysis

* Diagnostic analysis is more complex in LMM than in the standard case because the three types of residuals :

 + Marginal Residuals : Predicts marginal errors
 + Condtional Residuals : Predicts conditional errors
 + Random effects Residuals : predicts the random effects
 
* Complication to this is the concept of confounding, when error depends on other errors than it was supposed to predict. 
 
 + We consider the least confounding residuals.
 
* In this research project, we detect the existence of abnormal observations from conditional residuals, and confounded residuals as well as evaluate the normality of conditional errors based on conditional residuals versus
confounding conditional residuals.

# How ?

--

**Graphical Diagnostics**

* Graphical diagnostics focusing on the residual analysis are alternative methods to test
the hypotheses based on the simulation approaches such as parametric bootstrap applied
in the lineup protocol. 

* Visual inference
is  tool based on the application of **lineup protocol** which constitutes of usually,
19 null plots, and one data plot that randomly inserts among the null plots based on the
experimental design setup that we created. These lineups are then presented to a number
of (possibly independent) observers for evaluation.

 + The null hypothesis : The plot is not distinguishable from the null plots. 
 
 + Alternate hypothesis : Some differences found in the data plot compared to null plots.
 
 + The corresponding p-value is calculated.

# Summer Research Project 

* Four diagnostic maps are employed. 

* A survey is created to validate the methods and to find which residual is better at checking the presence of outlying observations and exploring whether the conditional errors follow a normal
distribution. 

---

# Data used


* Sleep deprivation study data set in the R package lme4. 

18 subjects. 10 days. Normal sleep on Day 0. Rest of nights 3 hours of sleep administered. Reaction variable records average reaction time (ms) per day. 
 
```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=5}

data("sleepstudy")
ggplot(sleepstudy, aes(Days, Reaction)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Subject) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  ggtitle("Average reaction time of each subject")
```

---

# Experimental Setup

* The experiment is administered over two versions of data with 5 replicates : 

  + Without noise
 
  + Data injected with Noise level of 20% of mean reaction time added to 33% of the participants over random 2 days. 

The noise level was chosen such that the data plot is noticeable enough but not too obvious. 

*  Parametric bootstrap approach to generate the null data for each lineup. 
 
 + Vector of random effects and conditional residuals generated. 
 
 + Bootstrap sample $\mathbf{y}^*_i$ from $\mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{X}_i \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} + \mathbf{Z}_i \mathbf{b}^*_i + \mathbf{e}^*_i$ for each group $i = 1, 2, ...,n$ and the model refitted to the bootstrap sample.
 
These are repeated for 19 times and The line ups were generated using the R package nullabor.
