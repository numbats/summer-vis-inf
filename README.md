# Residual diagnostics for mixed models

This is the repo for a 2020-2021 summer project to conduct a visual inference study on appropriate residual diagnostics for multi-level models. 

* Based on work by [Kaiwen Jin Master's thesis](https://github.com/kaiwenjanet/master).
* The Shiny app for the experiment is available [here](https://kaiwen-jin.shinyapps.io/experiment/).

# Overall goal

* Build from Kaiwen's thesis

1. Clean up shiny app
2. Check metric underlying is correct
3. Run experiment 

# Milestone

## 2020/12/07

* Read Kaiwen's thesis and go through Shiny app code 

## 2020/12/11: 

* Read [these papers](https://paperpile.com/shared/dxNYN7). Might be best to start off with Graphical inference for infovis paper. 
* Note: Singer et al. paper is hard to read. 
* **Write a summary as you read.** 
* Commit summaries and other additions regularly to this repo.
* Over summer break, get the R Shiny experiment working and embed your own lineup.

## 2020/01/07:

* [carry over] get the R Shiny experiment working and embed your own lineup
* Work through the code by Kaiwen to get the confounded conditional residual.
